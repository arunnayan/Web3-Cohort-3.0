Notes:

1. Programs/Smart contracts:
    - ETH was one of the first blockchains to introduce the `concept` of decentralized `state` / `programs`. 
    - These are popularly known as `smart contracts` on the ETH blockchain.
    - HTTP Servers are deployed on cloud providers like `GCP, Azure`
    - Smart contracts/programs are deployed on the `blockchain`

2. Accounts on Solana:
    - On the Solana blockchain, an "account" is a fundamental data structure used to store various types of information.
        1. Data Storage: Accounts on Solana are used to store data required by programs (smart contracts) or to maintain state
        2. Lamports: Accounts hold a balance of Solanaâ€™s native cryptocurrency, lamports. Lamports are used to pay for transaction fees and to rent the space that the account occupies on the blockchain. {1 SOL = 1000000000 Lamports}
        3. Programs: On Solana, programs are special accounts that contain executable code. These accounts are distinct from regular data accounts in that they are designed to be executed by the blockchain when triggered by a transaction.

3. Rents on Solana:
    - Rent is a mechanism on the Solana blockchain that ensures efficient usage of the blockchain's resources. 
    - It requires accounts to maintain a minimum balance proportional to the amount of data they store on the network. 
    - Accounts that fail to maintain this minimum balance will be removed from the ledger to free up storage.
    - Rent is refundable. If an account is closed (removed from the network), the data is deleted from the chain and the rent is refunded to the account owner (or other defined account).
